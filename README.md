# üåå COSMIC + Regolith Hybrid Environment with Cosmic Session Integration

Integrating COSMIC's system daemons and `cosmic-session` into a Regolith (i3-based) environment.

---

## üß† Objective

This project demonstrates how to integrate `cosmic-session` into Regolith to harness the modern system services provided by COSMIC‚Äîwhile keeping the lightweight, keyboard-centric workflow of the i3 window manager.  
The goal is to ensure that key components like settings, on-screen displays (OSDs), and idle settings function as intended within this hybrid desktop setup.

## üß© System Info

| Component         | Details                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Distro**       | Ubuntu-based with Regolith         |
| **Window Manager** | i3 (via Regolith)                 |
| **COSMIC Components** | `cosmic-session`, `cosmic-settings-daemon` |
| **Enhancements** | Updated Regolith components for `cosmic-session` integration |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Regolith

Start by installing Regolith on your system:

```bash
# Add the Regolith repository and update package list
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release
sudo apt update

# Install the Regolith desktop
sudo apt install regolith-desktop
```

### 2. Update Regolith Components to Use Cosmic-Session

#### Configure Regolith to Launch Cosmic-Session

Update your Regolith configuration (typically in `~/.config/regolith/i3/config` or similar) to replace or integrate the session startup with `cosmic-session`.

Ensure that commands related to settings, OSDs, and idle handling are directed to `cosmic-session` instead of Regolith defaults.

---

#### Integrate COSMIC Background Daemons

If you haven't already, set up the `cosmic-settings-daemon` as a systemd user service:

```bash
sudo apt install xdg-user-dirs xdg-utils
mkdir -p ~/.config ~/.local/state ~/.cache

export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export XDG_STATE_HOME="$HOME/.local/state"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$HOME/.cache"
```

Now create the service file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/cosmic-settings-daemon.service
```

Paste the following into the service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=COSMIC Settings Daemon
After=graphical.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cosmic-settings-daemon
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Reload and start the service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reexec
systemctl --user enable --now cosmic-settings-daemon.service
```

---

### 3. Verifying Functionality

#### ‚úÖ Settings & OSDs

With `cosmic-session` active, system settings and on-screen displays should now use COSMIC‚Äôs modern UI elements.

#### ‚úÖ Idle Settings

Idle detection and related power management settings should be handled by `cosmic-session`, offering a seamless experience.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter repetitive logs (e.g., `No such file or directory (os error 2)`), these are typically non-breaking messages due to the partial COSMIC stack.

To resolve daemon conflicts:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
systemctl --user restart cosmic-settings-daemon.service
```

---

### üß≠ Planned Integrations

The current `cosmic-session` integration is just the beginning. Future enhancements include:

- `cosmic-panel` ‚Äî A unified top bar experience.
- `cosmic-comp` ‚Äî A Wayland-based compositor.
- `cosmic-launcher` ‚Äî A native application launcher.
- `cosmic-settings-ui` ‚Äî A visual control center.
- `cosmic-keybinds` ‚Äî A native keybinding daemon.
- `cosmic-udev` ‚Äî A hardware events listener.

These integrations aim to further blend the high-performance, minimalistic design of Regolith with the comprehensive system management features of COSMIC.

### üß© Why This Setup?

This hybrid desktop environment combines:

- üöÄ **Performance and responsiveness** of Regolith/i3  
- üé® **System-level polish** offered by COSMIC services  
- üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Streamlined user experience** with integrated settings, OSDs, and idle management
